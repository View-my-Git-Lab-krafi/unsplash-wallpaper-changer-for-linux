## Getting started

### Run this one line and see your wallpaper is changing every 1 min

```

```

### if you don't like those categories I am using them for my wallpaper...

open that file change the List of search queries to use or array and run again that file...

### Regulations are not correct?

you can find this line at the top of the script

```
monitor_resolution="1920x1080"
```
modify that 1920x1080 to another value...

Don't know your monitor resolution?

run 

```
xrandr
```
Do you want to see my output of that command?
